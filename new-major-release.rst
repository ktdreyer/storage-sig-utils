Setting up a new Ceph release
=============================

The next release of Ceph is codenamed "nautilus". We want to build and host
this in CentOS's system. Here are the steps to set that up.

Installing CBS client
---------------------

Please install the CBS client (CLI) on your system. You will need it to build
new RPMs and manage builds. Instructions at https://wiki.centos.org/SIGGuide

Configuring CBS
---------------

The first step is to open a `ticket <https://bugs.centos.org/>`_ with the
CentOS CBS administrators. The CBS admins will configure three things for us:

1. Create our set of Koji tags (eg. ``-candidate``, ``-testing``, and
   ``-release``).

2. Create our Koji build `target <http://cbs.centos.org/koji/buildtargets>`_
   (eg. ``storage7-ceph-nautilus-el7``).

3. `Configure <https://wiki.centos.org/SIGGuide/Content/BuildLogs>`_ the Yum
   repository "downloads" `site <https://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/7/>`_ for
   the builds.
   
Here is the nautilus ticket: https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=15269 (`A
script <new-major-release.py>` can file these automatically.)

Creating centos-release-ceph-nautilus package
---------------------------------------------

For each major Ceph release, we must create a "-release" package.

This process is `in flux
<https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-devel/2018-November/017093.html>`_,
but basically we will need to coordinate with Niels de Vos <ndevos@redhat.com>
to create the new repository in GitHub for this package.

Once you have the GitHub repository location:

1. Copy the `centos-release-ceph-luminous
<https://github.com/CentOS-Storage-SIG/centos-release-ceph-luminous>`_ release
package, and globally search-and-replace "luminous" to "nautilus". Note the
``.repo`` file is named "Luminous", so rename this to "Nautilus", etc.

2. Create the SRPM (see the instructions in the README)::

    rpmbuild -bs ...

3. Build the SRPM with CBS (see instructions in the README)::

    cbs build ...

At this point you will have your first build in CBS.

Moving builds through -testing and -release
-------------------------------------------

When you build anything in CBS, the system will automatically tag that build
into the ``-candidate`` tag. ``-candidate`` just means that the build *could*
go somewhere, but it is not ready to go into a testing Yum repository yet.

Continuing from above, your ``centos-release-ceph-nautilus`` package will be
tagged into ``core7-extras-common-candidate`` to start.

To move this build into the "testing" repository, we will tag it into the
``-testing`` CBS tag::

    cbs tag-build core7-extras-common-testing centos-release-ceph-nautilus-1.1-1.el7.centos

Once the build is in ``core7-extras-common-testing``, the CBS administrators
will put it into the "testing" repository at
https://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/ . A cron job runs every
two hours to push builds to the testing repository.

To move this build into the "release" repository, we will tag it into the
``-release`` CBS tag::

    cbs tag-build core7-extras-common-release centos-release-ceph-nautilus-1.1-1.el7.centos

Once the build is in the ``-release`` tag, the CBS administrators will GPG-sign
it and put it into the main Yum repositories that are mirrored everywhere. For
``core7-extras-common-release``, this is
http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/.  (TODO: figure out what
triggers this, and how long to wait).

Using the centos-release-ceph-nautilus package
----------------------------------------------

From this point our ``centos-release-ceph-nautilus`` package is pushed out to
CentOS' mirror system for CentOS Extras. All CentOS users can "yum install" our
build from CentOS Extras now::

    # Already done on most CentOS systems:
    yum-config-manager --enable extras

    # Install our newly-released build: 
    yum install centos-release-ceph-nautilus

Now these users will have an ``/etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Ceph-Nautlius.repo`` on
their systems. This will point at the rest of our Ceph packages.
